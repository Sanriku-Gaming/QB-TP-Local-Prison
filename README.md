This script is designed so that players who do not need to be sent to state prison can be sent to police station cells based on their ID and sentence time.

The commands used are /jail1, /jail2, /jail3 and jail4

Example: /jail1 [Id] [time].

At the moment any player can use the commands. A condition needs to be added so that only players with the police job can use the command. Any kind of help is appreciated.
